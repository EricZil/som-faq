      "answer": "Shipping means you have finished your project (or V1 of it) and have submitted it for manual review by the team. After a few weeks (less than that if you vote a lot!), it gets certified.\nAfter certification it is voted on by the community. This can take from a few days to even a week (but generally a few days only). Then you get shells based on the hours you did and the votes you got!\n\nOpen your project. There it should say \"ship certified\" in green when your project has been reviewed. Otherwise, it says \"awaiting ship certification\"\nThere might be a bug where it says something else in another page, but what it says on the specific project's page should be final!",

    {
      "question": "How are shells calculated?",
      "answer": "[Answer improved] Shell calculation works in two phases:\n\n**Base Rate (Guaranteed):**\n• You get 1 shell per hour worked - this is guaranteed if your project is accepted, even if no one votes for you\n\n**Community Voting Multiplier:**\n• After certification, your project goes to community voting\n• You can earn up to 30 shells per hour by getting the maximum votes\n• The final amount depends on how many community members vote for your project\n\n**Example:** For a 10-hour project, you can expect to earn between 10 shells (base rate) and 300 shells (maximum with all votes). Most projects fall somewhere in between based on community reception.\n\n**Technical Formula:**\nThe exact multiplier calculation uses this formula:\n```\nn + (((2.0*x-1.0) * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (1.0 - ((2.0*x-1.0)**2.0 / 2.0))) + 1.0) / 2.0) ** Math.log((a-n) / (m-n), t) * (m-n)\n```\nWhere the variables represent different aspects of the voting distribution and project parameters. The key takeaway: more community votes = more shells!",
